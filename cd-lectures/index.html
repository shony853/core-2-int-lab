    <p>
    The first thing that came to mind when I saw the first screen of Elaine's lecture was 
    "was design ever colonized?" As I understood more about the use of this term in the design 
    industry and her opinions on this topic, my question was answered naturally, Design was never 
    colonized, it was instead a tool to colonize. Therefore, it is unsuitable to use the term 
    "decolonization" to explain the diversity in design styles, moved on from the universal eurocentric 
    design. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After listening to her lecture, I realized that I wasn't aware of the eurocentric design 
    being the standard for all commercial designs- the fonts, compositions, and colors. That was 
    all of what I know about designs and the way that I thought all design styles were. Now that I 
    am aware of this situation, I think it is a task for young designers including myself to figure 
    out or discover a style that is new and innovative. Understanding that I am in the best education 
    environment full of diversity, surrounded by open-minded people who give sharp critiques and are 
    supportive, I think this is the time we should really think about the fundamentals of design and 
    a new way of approach. At this point, I think the importance of having confidence in my own work 
    and being brave to try something new can't be stressed enough. One might be paving the way for a 
    new era of design without even knowing.
