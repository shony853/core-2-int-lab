    <p>
    The first thing that came to mind when I saw the first screen of Elaine's lecture was 
    "was design ever colonized?" As I understood more about the use of this term in the design 
    industry and her opinions on this topic, my question was answered naturally, Design was never 
    colonized, it was instead a tool to colonize. Therefore, it is unsuitable to use the term 
    "decolonization" to explain the diversity in design styles, moved on from the universal eurocentric 
    design. 
    <br>
    After listening to her lecture, I realized that I wasn't aware of the eurocentric design 
    being the standard for all commercial designs- the fonts, compositions, and colors. That was 
    all of what I know about designs and the way that I thought all design styles were. Now that I 
    am aware of this situation, I think it is a task for young designers including myself to figure 
    out or discover a style that is new and innovative. Understanding that I am in the best education 
    environment full of diversity, surrounded by open-minded people who give sharp critiques and are 
    supportive, I think this is the time we should really think about the fundamentals of design and 
    a new way of approach. At this point, I think the importance of having confidence in my own work 
    and being brave to try something new can't be stressed enough. One might be paving the way for a 
    new era of design without even knowing.

    <h2><span class="title">Lynn Kiang</span> on <span class="date">February 17th</span></h2>
    <time> </time>
    <p> The way Kiang started her lecture by asking the audience to share the meaning of their names was inspiring. This drew my attention not only because it was interesting to hear what the lecturer’s name meant, but also because I know my name has a meaning but didn’t really think about that in everyday life. Then something clicked in my head that there would be meanings to all the choices people make in designs as well. Listening to her lecture helped me imagine what the life of a designer would be like post-graduation, which I didn’t really spend much time thinking about since I thought I had a long way to go. She gave practical and heartful advice to students as a person who has been in the industry, to “steal everything.” By this, she meant to try to use up and take all from the opportunities you get through in terms of learning tips, facilities, and connections because it is hard to come back to the place you once were, and absorbing new things will only be helpful to you in the future. I was also surprised when she said that making and maintaining human connections is crucial in participating in projects because a lot of the time they start from a conversation between designers of different individual studios. I hope to make great connections in the environment that couldn’t be any better and I hope to become one of the essential connections to the people around me would be happy to have.
