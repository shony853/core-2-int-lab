        Reading this piece reminded me of things I didnâ€™t realize I had experience with. Most of the elements that were introduced as the disappearing aesthetics of the past like the under-construction sign and the starry background were things that I would never have known before but the general aesthetic of the signs and symbols share were reminiscent of the general digital arts that were around me when I was little- the vibrant colors, 3d looking designs, somewhat glaring effects. Although minimalism and simplicity are the keys in the modern days, I think bringing back the same comic-like aesthetic to the improved concepts of modern society can be an interesting factor that can be used to emphasize certain functions and meanings. Overall, it was interesting to find out about the creative and aesthetic symbols of the past in an organized manner and what kinds of ideas led to the creation of these symbols.
