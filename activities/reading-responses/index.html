    <h2> <span class="title">A vernacular web</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina</span></h2>
    <time>  </time>
    <p>
        Reading this piece reminded me of things I didn’t realize I had experience with. Most of the elements that were introduced as the disappearing aesthetics of the past like the under-construction sign and the starry background were things that I would never have known before but the general aesthetic of the signs and symbols share were reminiscent of the general digital arts that were around me when I was little- the vibrant colors, 3d looking designs, somewhat glaring effects. Although minimalism and simplicity are the keys in the modern days, I think bringing back the same comic-like aesthetic to the improved concepts of modern society can be an interesting factor that can be used to emphasize certain functions and meanings. Overall, it was interesting to find out about the creative and aesthetic symbols of the past in an organized manner and what kinds of ideas led to the creation of these symbols.

    <h2> <span class="title">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</span> by <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></h2>

    <p>
        In this reading, Laurel Schwulst uses poetic metaphors to explain the different aspects of websites and how they influence themselves by both holding information and being the information itself. The author argues that it is problematic that the internet is referred to as a “cloud,” and this part was the most impressive to me. Cloud is a term used in different browsers and systems to indicate a pack of information and it is used generally with the development of internet society by reading this part I realized that I’ve never thought that this term started from a metaphor- I have just so naturally have been perceiving it as a proper noun, without questioning. She offers new metaphors that are more suitable to call the concept and those were a flock of birds or a sea of punctuation marks, to embrace the fact that each of the creative nodes is what makes up the web.

    <h2> <span class="title">Typography and the Screen</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>

    <p>
        This reading argues the relationship between tools and design. The invention of new tools leads to the development of the whole society. Therefore it not only leads to the elevation in quality but also widens the spectrum of diversity to design which sometimes creates a new style or genre. Nowadays, we can choose to make something retro design because now we have more data in terms of reference and types as time goes by and now there are more choices to choose from and the tools to embody the idea accurately. The passage introduced a term that was interesting to me, WYSIWYG. It is an abbreviation for “What You See Is What You Get.” I agree with the idea and think this could be applied to the design industry and any existing knowledge. Without knowing the existence of certain mediums, it would be impossible to come up with ideas that communicate by utilizing the unique characteristics of the mediums. Understanding the functions and characteristics of computers would have provoked new inspirations and new ways of communication in design in terms of aesthetics, convenience, and practicality. Would that mean that the tools used in a design can’t be replaced in order to call it the same design?

    <h2><span class="title">The Web's Grain</span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h2>
    <time> </time>
    <p>
        This reading cheered me up by claiming the ideas that I agree with, relieved me of being scared of making websites, and encouraged me by helping me set some standards for my design goals. I was deeply inspired by this part in the reading that says we eventually work through the naive belief that profundity comes from complication. As a person who agrees with the idea that knowing and being able to do something doesn’t always that you should do it, I couldn’t agree more with the part “ it is fascinating that you can do that, but it’s really not what a website is supposed to do.”
Also, I am still unsure of how to think of websites as a tool rather than a blank canvas. This makes sense to me in a way that I should always remember the reason and aim of the making of this website fundamentally, but I can’t imagine how I would be able to do that. I felt like this would be something that I need to work on to find the answer.

    <h2><span class="title">Black Gooey Universe</span> by <span class="author"> by American Artist</span></h2>
    <time> </time>
    <p>
        The article explains the meaning of GUI (graphical user interface) and how it is developed, and the whiteness of the screen we all know, but didn’t realize. GUI is often called “gooey,” and this was developed primarily from a project to create an accessible computer in order to lessen the burden of the developers. This then naturally led to the emergence of the “user.” 
        I was also very surprised by the fact that whiteness is still the core of silicon valley. Although I acknowledge the early days of the engineering industry would have been white and male-based environments, I never expected such a well-known place for openness, freedom, and no restriction would still be a white-centered place. I think this is absurd, especially for this industry where their ultimate role is to develop interfaces for diverse people around the world. 
        The part “the screen never represents something existent elsewhere but renders for the first time all things are seen, whether a reference exists prior to its representation on screen is arbitrary.” stood out to me because this helped me deepen my understanding of what a screen or a website holds both in terms of context and as a medium. </p>
