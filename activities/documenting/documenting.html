  <div class="description">
    This website is a collection of 25 fragrances that 4 of my friends and I own. I tend to remember the times I spent
    with people by their scent, so this collection has a special meaning to me in a way that it is an archive of
    memories I have made with some of my favorite people.
    I used different fonts for each person, and I tried to find the ones that best express the image I have of the person.
